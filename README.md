# Simple API Worker

Just a simple test API on my part to take a look at how CloudFlare workers can
work, and test some of the simple features like Secrets. I'll maybe leave this
up in case people find it useful to use as an example, I guess.

Probs some things I could be handling better like the CORS configuration.
